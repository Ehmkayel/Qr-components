## My process
I downloaded the zip file from frontend mentor github,
Opened the folder on my vscode
I created some div container so as to structure my work and I added some class attributes to make my styling easier,
after completing the html structure, I created an external css file which I used in styling my html(to keep my code organized).
then I use some css selectors and properties when styling my code


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- QR Image
- Css selectors
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Multi line comments and html comments

### What I learned

I learned how to use markups and I brushed up my html and css while creating the components
